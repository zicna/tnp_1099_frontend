Refactoring Input (Any)Field:

each input has 3 type of state:

1. input value
    a. function that will set value
2. input validity (true / false) 
    a. function that will set value for input validity
3. input was touched (true / false) 
    a. function that will set value for input was touched

each input uses these 2 functions:
1. handleInputChange
    instant input value update
2. handleInputBlur 
    instant change of "input was touched" state
